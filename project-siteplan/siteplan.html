                <h3>Site Name:</h3>
                <p>The name for this site is Ailed Recipes. I chose that name because it is almost the same that my
                    YouTube Channel's
                    name. Ailed is my alias on internet and recetas y detalles are Spanish words that means recipes and
                    details in English that represents the content in the channel.
                </p>

                <h3>Site Purpose:</h3>
                <p>This site will allow the user learn step by step how to prepare delicious recipes. In this site the
                    user will
                    find photos and the complete recipe of differents dishes and desserts. Also the website will
                    offers
                    links to my YouTube channel explaining some of the recipes in video. The website will have the
                    advantage that
                    the user will be able to find more differents recipes than in my YouTube channel. Also they will
                    have the opportunity
                    to tell me by a comment or suggestion what recipes they are interested and what they would like it
                    to
                    be recored in a video.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Scenarios</h3>
                <p>Two scenarios are provided for this web site in the home page. The first one answer the question that
                    maybe could ask
                    the user, and it is: What should I cook today? To answer that question, I will create
                    a section in the
                    home page that will show an h2 that will say “Cook this for meal today”. This section will show some
                    spotlights recipes for cooking.

                    The second answer the question: Any dessert without using an oven? To answer that question, I will
                    create
                    another section that will display spotlights dessert recipes easy to prepare without oven.
